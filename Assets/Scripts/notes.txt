(Theoretical means not directly represented in game)

Procedural Algorithm 2D 1 Floor
    Room Layout
    -Generate randomly sized rectangles within a certain radius (Rooms)
    -Use an algotithm to seperate the Rooms so that they aren't overlapping
    -Find the Delaunay Triangulation between center points of Rooms 
    -Find Minium Spanning Tree between center points of Rooms
    -Passages = MST + Some amount from (DT - MST)
    -Determine spawn and boss

    Metroidvaniation
    -Randomly add blank Impediments to Passages
    -Randomly select rooms to be divided into Subrooms
    -Divide rooms internally into Subrooms and IntraPassages
    -Give these IntraPassages blank Impediments
    -Use an algotithm to decide what each Impediment should be, and how to open each one
    -Test if floor is completable
    -Modify based on cost factors (Time/Length, Variety, Shortcuts?)

    Convert from Theoretical to Real
    -Working from a tiled map
    -Use A* to pathfind Coridors for Passages
    -Decide where to place Impediments on each passage
    -Place IntraPassage Impediments in rooms
    -Convert from tiled map to 3D render

    Passages = Theoretical class
-Link from a portal to another portal
-Can have Impediments

    Rooms = Theoretical class
-Have a list of Portals (entry/exits)
-Can be broken up into Subrooms and IntraPassages

    Subrooms = Extends Room
-Used to break up a room into different areas
-Connected to other sub rooms with IntraPassages

    IntraPassages = Extends Passage
-Link from one sub room to another
-Can have special types of Impediments
  
    Impediments = Theoretical class 
-Has a location (Passage / IntraPassage)
-Have two states
    -Closed
    -Open
-Many different types
    -Locked doors
    -Gaps to big to jump
    -Blocks of Ice needed to be melted
    -One way ledges
    -etc
-While closed traversal can be (A -> B) || (B -> A) || (NONE)
-While open traversal can be (A -> B) || (B -> A) || (A <-> B)
-Status is based on some function of the following
    -Devices turned on
    -Keys in players possesion
